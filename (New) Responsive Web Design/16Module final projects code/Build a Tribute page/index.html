                        attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                        Depression era program known as the "National Youth
                        Administration"
                    </li>

                        more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,
                        helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed
                        them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a
                        job in the US Forestry Service
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by
                        Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under
                        Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
                        plants.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
                        the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,
                        DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
                        science.
                    </li>

                        <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and
                        Plant Pathology

                        from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies
                        to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over
                        the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
                        strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
                        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat
                        twice each season, doubling wheat yields
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf
                        breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
                        creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It
                        goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                    </li>

                        <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his
                        high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
                        subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation
                        due to a rapidly expanding population
                    </li>

                        <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished
                        professor at Texas A&M University
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double
                        the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
                        modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,
                        as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
                        inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
                        modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
                        before we called it science, people were selecting the
                        best breeds."
