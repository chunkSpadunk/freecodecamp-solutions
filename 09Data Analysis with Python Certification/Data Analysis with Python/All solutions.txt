Introduction to Data Analysis
Which of the following is not part of Data Analysis?
Picking a desired conclusion for the analysis.


Data Analysis Example A
What does the shape of our dataframe tell us?
How many rows and columns our dataframe has.

What does the loc method allow you to do?
Access a group of rows and columns by supplying label(s) arguments.


How to use Jupyter Notebooks Intro
What is not allowed in a Jupyter Notebook's cell?
An Excel sheet


Jupyter Notebooks Cells
What are the three main types of Jupyter Notebook Cell?
Code, Markdown, and Raw


Jupyter Notebooks Importing and Exporting Data
What kind of data can you import and work with in a Jupyter Notebook?
All of the above.


Numpy Introduction A
Why is Numpy an important, but unpopular Python library?
Often you won't work directly with Numpy.


Numpy Introduction B
About how much memory does the integer 5 consume in plain Python?
20bytes 


Numpy Arrays
What will the following code print out?
A = np.array([
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    ['g', 'h', 'i']
])

print(A[:, :2])
[['a' 'b']
['d' 'e']
['g' 'h']]


Numpy Operations
What is the value of a after you run the following code?
a = np.arange(5)
a + 20
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


Numpy Boolean Arrays
What will the following code print out?
a = np.arange(5)

print(a <= 3)
[ True  True  True  True False]


Numpy Algebra and Size
What is the relationship between size of objects (such as lists and datatypes) in memory in Python's standard library and the NumPy library? Knowing this, what are the implications for performance?
Standard Python objects take up more memory than NumPy objects; operations on NumPy objects complete very quickly compared to comparable objects in standard Python.


Pandas Introduction
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd

certificates_earned = pd.Series(
    [8, 2, 5, 6],
    index=['Tom', 'Kris', 'Ahmad', 'Beau']
)

print(certificates_earned)
Tom 8 Kris 2 Ahmad 5 Beau 6 dtype: int64


Pandas Indexing and Conditional Selection
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd

certificates_earned = pd.Series(
    [8, 2, 5, 6],
    index=['Tom', 'Kris', 'Ahmad', 'Beau']
)

print(certificates_earned[certificates_earned > 5])
Tom      8
Beau     6
dtype: int64


Pandas DataFrames
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd

certificates_earned = pd.DataFrame({
    'Certificates': [8, 2, 5, 6],
    'Time (in months)': [16, 5, 9, 12]
})

certificates_earned.index = ['Tom', 'Kris', 'Ahmad', 'Beau']

print(certificates_earned.iloc[2])
Certificates        5
Time (in months)    9
Name: Ahmad, dtype: int64


Pandas Conditional Selection and Modifying DataFrames
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd

certificates_earned = pd.DataFrame({
    'Certificates': [8, 2, 5, 6],
    'Time (in months)': [16, 5, 9, 12]
})
names = ['Tom', 'Kris', 'Ahmad', 'Beau']

certificates_earned.index = names
longest_streak = pd.Series([13, 11, 9, 7], index=names)
certificates_earned['Longest streak'] = longest_streak

print(certificates_earned)
      Certificates  Time (in months)  Longest streak
Tom               8                16              13
Kris              2                 5              11
Ahmad             5                 9               9
Beau              6                12               7


Pandas Creating Columns
What code would add a "Certificates per month" column to the certificates_earned DataFrame like the one below?

      Certificates  Time (in months)  Certificates per month
Tom               8                16                    0.50
Kris              2                 5                    0.40
Ahmad             5                 9                    0.56
Beau              6                12                    0.50
certificates_earned['Certificates per month'] = round(
    certificates_earned['Certificates'] /
    certificates_earned['Time (in months)'], 2
)


Data Cleaning Introduction
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s = pd.Series(['a', 3, np.nan, 1, np.nan])

print(s.notnull().sum())
3


Data Cleaning with DataFrames
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd
