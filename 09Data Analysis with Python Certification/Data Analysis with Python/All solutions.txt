Numpy Introduction A
Why is Numpy an important, but unpopular Python library?
Often you won't work directly with Numpy.


Numpy Introduction B
About how much memory does the integer 5 consume in plain Python?
20bytes 


Numpy Arrays
What will the following code print out?
A = np.array([
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    ['g', 'h', 'i']
])

print(A[:, :2])
[['a' 'b']
['d' 'e']
['g' 'h']]

Numpy Algebra and Size
What is the relationship between size of objects (such as lists and datatypes) in memory in Python's standard library and the NumPy library? Knowing this, what are the implications for performance?
Standard Python objects take up more memory than NumPy objects; operations on NumPy objects complete very quickly compared to comparable objects in standard Python.

})

certificates_earned.index = ['Tom', 'Kris', 'Ahmad', 'Beau']

print(certificates_earned.iloc[2])
Certificates        5
Time (in months)    9
Name: Ahmad, dtype: int64


Pandas Conditional Selection and Modifying DataFrames

import pandas as pd

certificates_earned = pd.DataFrame({
    'Certificates': [8, 2, 5, 6],
    'Time (in months)': [16, 5, 9, 12]
})
names = ['Tom', 'Kris', 'Ahmad', 'Beau']

certificates_earned.index = names
longest_streak = pd.Series([13, 11, 9, 7], index=names)
certificates_earned['Longest streak'] = longest_streak

print(certificates_earned)
      Certificates  Time (in months)  Longest streak
Tom               8                16              13
Kris              2                 5              11
Ahmad             5                 9               9
Beau              6                12               7


Pandas Creating Columns
What code would add a "Certificates per month" column to the certificates_earned DataFrame like the one below?

      Certificates  Time (in months)  Certificates per month
Tom               8                16                    0.50
Kris              2                 5                    0.40
Ahmad             5                 9                    0.56
Beau              6                12                    0.50
certificates_earned['Certificates per month'] = round(
    certificates_earned['Certificates'] /
    certificates_earned['Time (in months)'], 2
)


Data Cleaning Introduction
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s = pd.Series(['a', 3, np.nan, 1, np.nan])

print(s.notnull().sum())
3


Data Cleaning with DataFrames
What will the following code print out?
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

s = pd.Series([np.nan, 1, 2, np.nan, 3])
s = s.fillna(method='ffill')

print(s)
0    NaN
1    1.0
2    2.0
3    2.0
4    3.0
dtype: float64


Data Cleaning Duplicates
The Python method .duplicated() returns a boolean Series for your DataFrame. True is the return value for rows that:
contain a duplicate, where the value for the row is at least the second occurrence of that value.


Data Cleaning and Visualizations
When using Matplotlib's global API, what does the order of numbers mean here?
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
My figure will have one row, two columns, and I am going to start drawing in the first (left) plot.


Reading Data Introduction
Given a file named certificates.csv with these contents:

Name$Certificates$Time (in months)
Tom$8$16
Kris$2$5
