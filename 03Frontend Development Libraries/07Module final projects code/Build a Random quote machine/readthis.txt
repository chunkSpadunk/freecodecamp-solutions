upon starting this project to use react 18 there was a problem with one of the test cases 
the issue is highlighted here
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/45922

the solution is to downgrade to react 17 but this causes conflict with the other dependencies which by default are configured to work with the latest versions of react that are installed when we run the command npx create-react-app my-app
So, for now I will be using vanilla JS to finish this project and will come back to finish this project in react later
